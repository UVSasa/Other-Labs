Overview

I will be setting up a corporate-style IT ticketing system using osTicket on my Ubuntu VM. This system lets users report problems (tickets) and lets IT staff track, respond, and resolve them — just like a real IT helpdesk.

1. Environment Setup
  * Tools used: VMware Workstation, Windows VM, Ubuntu VM.
  * Configured networking so both VMs could communicate (ping tested Windows ↔ Ubuntu).
  * Goal: Simulate a small IT network where support and admin tasks could be performed.
