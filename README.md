# Other Labs


üß™ Miscellaneous Labs

This repository is a collection of miscellaneous labs and practice projects that don‚Äôt neatly fit into my main cybersecurity-focused repositories. While my GitHub account primarily highlights cybersecurity projects, this repo will include additional IT-related labs, system administration tasks, and general technical exercises that support building well-rounded skills.

üìå Purpose

    - Serve as a central place for side labs that are useful but not tied to a single project theme.

    - Document IT fundamentals (e.g., Active Directory, ticketing systems, account management).

    - Extend cybersecurity practice by covering related IT skills that are often part of real-world security/IT operations.
